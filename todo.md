## Features
1. ~~The "Sondertilgung" should be more adjustable. It needs to be entered as absolute value instead of % as well. If the % is adjusted the input for the absolute value needs to be recalculated and vice-versa. That way the user is not dependent on the banks unit (ie % vs absolute values).~~

2. There should be tooltips that either show via an info-icon that is clickable or hoverable for the calculated monthly rate, indicating how the monthly rate was calculated. Also there should be one for "Bundesland" indicating why the selection of the federal state province is required so a user better understands why data was required.

3. There should be a way to save the currently used settings/results and have a possibility to compare different results with each other easier.

4. The interest costs and remaining debt should optionally be shown in some sort of table, unraveled by year with remaining debt at the start of the year, how much % goes toward repayment and interest costs respectively as well as how much € was paid each year totally and how much debt remains. The table should also consider the special repayment if it was selected.

5. There should be some kind of rating for the result. This rating needs to be based on the common offers banks gave in the past 12 months.

6. ~~The "Eigenkapital" should be more adjustable. It needs to be entered as absolute value as well as a % value. If the % is adjusted the input for the absolute value needs to be recalculated and vice-versa. That way the user is not dependent on the banks unit (ie % vs absolute values).~~

## UI bugs
1. ~~The initial view on a mobile device is wider than the screen and requires scrolling left and right or manually zooming out. It is supposed to take 100% available width on mobile devices by default.~~

2. ~~The labels on the inputs sometimes have line-breaks due to their length. This causes the alignment of multiple inputs next to each other to break and looks bad. They should always be aligned if possible.~~
